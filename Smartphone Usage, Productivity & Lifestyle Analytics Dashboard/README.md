## 🏢 Business Problem

Excessive smartphone usage is increasingly affecting:

- Workplace productivity  
- Mental health and stress levels  
- Sleep quality  
- Lifestyle balance  

Currently, management and researchers lack structured visibility into:

- Which users are highly productive vs low productive  
- Which groups experience high stress  
- Whether smartphone usage affects sleep and productivity  
- How device type influences behavior  
- Which behavioral groups are at risk of burnout  

Without clear analytical insights, it is difficult to design effective productivity strategies, digital wellness programs, and behavioral interventions.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Analyze smartphone usage behavior and identify heavy usage patterns  
- Evaluate productivity levels and determine performance drivers  
- Measure stress levels and identify stress-inducing factors  
- Track sleep patterns and their relationship with productivity  
- Compare Android vs iOS behavioral differences  
- Segment users into behavioral clusters  
- Provide actionable insights for digital wellness and performance improvement
